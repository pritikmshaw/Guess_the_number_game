# Game
## Its a number guessing game using C language 

### We will create a program that generates a random number and ask the player to guess the number. If the player guess it higher than the actual number then it displays "LOWER NUMBER PLEASE ! " Similarly if the users guesses it too low then it displays "HIGHER NUMBER PLEASE! ". When the user guesses the correct number the programs displays the number of guesses the player used to guess the number.
